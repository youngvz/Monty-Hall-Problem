# Monty Hall Problem

## This repository contains code to simulate the famous Monty Hall Problem.
Users are prompted to initially select a door. Once they make their selection, they are shown the contents of a random door.
The user then has the option to change their selected door.

Once the user confirms his final choice, every door will open and reveal to the contestant if they have won or lost!
